SynapseML is built on the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Spark distributed computing framework</a> and shares the same API as the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/mllib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SparkML/MLLib library</a>, allowing you to seamlessly embed SynapseML models into existing Apache Spark workflows.</p><p>With SynapseML, you can build scalable and intelligent systems to solve challenges in domains such as anomaly detection, computer vision, deep learning, text analytics, and others. SynapseML can train and evaluate models on single-node, multi-node, and elastically resizable clusters of computers. This lets you scale your work without wasting resources. SynapseML is usable across Python, R, Scala, Java, and .NET. Furthermore, its API abstracts over a wide variety of databases, file systems, and cloud data stores to simplify experiments no matter where data is located.</p><p>SynapseML requires Scala 2.12, Spark 3.2+, and Python 3.8+.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The process of deploying Machine Learning (ML) algorithms within databases is challenging. The varied computational footprints of modern ML algorithms and the myriad of database technologies, each with their own restrictive syntax, make such tasks more than a little complex. We introduce an Apache Spark-based micro-service orchestration <!-- --> framework that extends database operations to include web service primitives. Our system can orchestrate web services across hundreds of machines and takes full advantage of cluster, thread, and asynchronous parallelism. Using this framework, we provide large scale clients for intelligent services such as speech, vision, search, anomaly detection, and text analysis. These clients allow users to integrate ready-to-use intelligence into any datastore with an Apache Spark connector. To eliminate much of the overhead from network communication, we also introduce a low-latency containerized version of our architecture. We demonstrate that the services we investigate are competitive on several important benchmarks. Finally, we present two applications of this framework to create intelligent search engines and real-time auto race analytics systems.</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/large-scale-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read More</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

More specifically, Microsoft Machine Learning for Apache Spark (MMLSpark for short), a powerful yet elastic open source machine learning library that’s finding its way beyond business and into “AI for Good” applications such as the environment and the arts.</p><p>Today, Mark talks about his love of mathematics and his desire to solve big, crazy, core knowledge-sized problems. He tells us all about MMLSpark and how it’s being used by organizations like the Snow Leopard Trust and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We introduce Microsoft Machine Learning for Apache Spark (MMLSpark), an ecosystem of enhancements that expand the Apache Spark distributed computing library. The library tackles problems in Deep Learning, Micro-Service Orchestration, Gradient Boosting, Model Interpretability, and other areas of modern computation. <!-- --> Furthermore, we present a novel system called Spark Serving that allows users to run any Apache Spark program as a distributed, submillisecond latency web service backed by their existing Spark Cluster. All MMLSpark contributions have the same API to enable simple composition across frameworks and usage across batch, streaming, and RESTful web serving scenarios on static, elastic, or serverless clusters. We showcase MMLSpark by creating a method for deep object detection capable of learning without human labeled data and demonstrate its effectiveness for Snow Leopard conservation.</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mmlspark-unifying-machine-learning-ecosystems-at-massive-scales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read More</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this work, we detail a novel open source library called MMLSpark that combines the flexible deep learning library Cognitive Toolkit with the distributed computing framework Apache Spark. To achieve this union, we have contributed Java Language bindings to the Cognitive Toolkit <!-- --> and added several new components to the Spark ecosystem. In addition, we integrate OpenCV, the popular image processing library, with Spark. We present a tool that automatically generates PySpark wrappers from any SparkML estimator, and we use this tool to expose all work to the PySpark ecosystem. Finally, we provide a large library of tools for working and developing within the Spark ecosystem. We apply this work to the automated classification of Snow Leopards from camera trap images, and provide an end-to-end solution for the non-profit conservation organization, the Snow Leopard Trust.</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/flexible-and-scalable-deep-learning-with-mmlspark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read More</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
